  <b>Description:</b>
  <br>Runtime error if the temperature of the heat sink temperature sensor TEMP_HEATSINK exceeds the limit (see INFO).
<br><br>
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Reaction:</b>
  <br>The 'controller ready' state is reset.
<br>When 'switch on controller' command: See error number <a href="4005.htm" tppabs="http://www.xn--brtschi-5wa.ch/automation/html/4005.htm">4005</a>.
<br>
<br>8V, 8BVI, 8CVI, 80V, 8DI:
<br>Default setting STOP_ERR_DECEL_RAMP=ncA_LIMIT:
<br>When position control is active (CONTROLLER_MODE=1 or 3):
<br>Movement stopped with the axis limits and by switching off the controller.
<br>When speed control is active (CONTROLLER_MODE=2):
<br>Movement stopped with speed regulated ramp, with axis limits and by switching off the controller.
<br>When U/f control is active (CONTROLLER_MODE=7): 
<br>Movement stopped with speed controlled ramp, with axis limits and by switching off the controller.
<br>When current control is active with commutation (CONTROLLER_MODE=4):
<br>Movement stopped with the current limits and by switching off the controller.
<br>
<br>Setting STOP_ERR_DECEL_RAMP=ncINDUCTION:
<br>Independent of controller mode: Movement is aborted with induction stop. See also error number <a href="9001.htm" tppabs="http://www.xn--brtschi-5wa.ch/automation/html/9001.htm">9001</a>.
<br>
<br>Setting STOP_ERR_DECEL_RAMP=ncCTRL_OFF:
<br>Independent of controller mode: Movement is aborted by switching off the controller and the power section immediately. The drive has no electrical torque.
<br>
<br>8B0P:
<br>The chopper output and the CR_OK output are switched off, the main relay is opened and the RDY-, RUN- and ERR LEDs flashes synchonous in 3 seconds cycle. The error condition can only be exited by switching off the mains supply.
<br>
<br>8BVP:
<br>The IGBT power stage is switched off.
<br><br>
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Cause/Remedy:</b>
  <br>Invalid operational conditions: 
<br>- Environmental temperature is higher than 40°C while in operation. -> Check the cool air temperature right after opening the intake.
<br>- Moderate air flow in the ACOPOS servo drive. -> Check the mounting direction and the covers on the intake opening.
<br>
<br>ACOPOS servo drive defect:
<br>-Cooling fan defect. -> Check if the fan makes any sound when the controller is on. The sound from the fan is louder when the heat sink temperature is high.
<br>- Problem with heat sink temperature measurement: -> When the controller is switched off, compare the environmental temperature with the temperature of the heat sink temperature sensor TEMP_HEATSINK.
<br>- If the thermal transition resistance between IGBT and the heat sink is too high, check the heat dissipation past between the heat sink and IGBT. -> Switch the ACOPOS servo drive.
