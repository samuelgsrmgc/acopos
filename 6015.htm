  <b>Description:</b>
  <br>Runtime error when using an AC110 plug-in card. Any CAN network node can detect malfunctions. To do this, a CAN node contains a send and receive error counter, which is incremented when a send or receive procedure containing an error is detected and is decremented when a send or receive procedure occurs without errors. The error counter is incremented further when an error occurs than it is decremented when the transfer is successful.
<br>Therefore, the state of the error counter is a measurement for the relative frequency of disturbances. If a network node detects an error which only has local effects, then the error flag triggered by this node causes a subsequent signal to all other network nodes. Using the point in time that the error flag was completed, the network nodes know if they were the first to signal the error. To localize the error, receive-errors and send-errors in the node that signaled an error while receiving or sending the node are incremented by a considerably higher amount (9x or 8x) than the counter of the secondary signalizing node. If the first detection of an error by the same node exceeds a certain frequency, then it is very likely that this node is defective. By exceeding certain error counter limits measures are taken to limit the influence of an affected node on the network. These measures include the notification of an increased error counter state, prohibiting the sending of active error flags when a high error counter state is reached and automatically switching off the node when a very high send-error counter state is reached. The counter state cannot be read.
<br>This error notifies of the arrival of the receive-error counter state 96.

  <b>Cause/Remedy:</b>
  <br>The network is interrupted or defective. See wiring guidelines error number <a href="7030.htm" tppabs="http://www.xn--brtschi-5wa.ch/automation/html/7030.htm">7030</a>.
<br>Check terminating resistors.
<br>AC110 plug-in card defective.
<br>CAN network defective in the entire system.
